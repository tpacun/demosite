        <p>All Spektrix integrations at this time require the use of an iframe in order to sell tickets online via your website. A lot of this text is generated automatically from the Spektrix system. However identifying the exact locations of where this text might be edited, as well as where it will appear on the given iframes is sometimes unclear.</p>
        <p>Using this site, you can navigate a generic purchase path marked with additional information on specific locations that the text is pulling through. If you know which iframe you'd like to look at, you can start directly with on of the links on the left.</p>
        <p>Certain iframes require specific parameters to appear - for this reason, there are not direct links to available to all of them. These include, but are not limited to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>EventDetails.aspx</li>
            <li>ChooseSeats.aspx</li>
            <li>EditTickets.aspx</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To look at these, you'll need to start with EventList.aspx or EventCalendar.aspx. To help with identifying the correct iframe page, each one will have a title at the top.</p>
        <p>You can find a full list of iframes and further technical documentation at <a href="https://integrate.spektrix.com/docs/standardbookingflow">Integration Portal: IFrame List</a></p>
